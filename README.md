# Digital Nurture 4.0 â€“ Java Full Stack Engineer (Java FSE)

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains all my hands-on exercises and assignments completed as part of Cognizantâ€™s **Digital Nurture 4.0 â€“ Java Full Stack Engineer** training program.

Iâ€™m currently working on **Week 1**, which focuses on:

- **Design Patterns and Principles**
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**

The repository will be updated regularly as I progress through each week of the program.
