Why Data Structures Matter:
When managing a big inventory, it's important to use the right data structures so we can quickly find, update, or remove products. The better the structure, the faster the system works â€” especially when dealing with thousands of items.

Which Data Structures Work Best:
- ArrayList is simple and easy to use. It's good if we want to keep items in order, but searching or updating can be slow when there are many products.
- HashMap is better for large inventories because we can add, update, or find products very quickly using their productId as a key.

Time Complexity (when using HashMap):
- Add: O(1)
- Update: O(1)
- Delete: O(1)
- Search: O(1)

How to Make It Even Better:
- Using productId as the key in the HashMap helps keep everything fast and organized.
- We can also check if a productId already exists before adding to avoid duplicates or overwriting by mistake.
