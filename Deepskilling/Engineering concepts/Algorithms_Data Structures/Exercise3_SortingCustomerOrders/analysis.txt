In this exercise, we tried sorting customer orders based on the total price so that high-value orders can be prioritized.

We implemented two sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort: Simple but slow. Good for understanding sorting logic.
- Quick Sort: Much faster and preferred in real-world use cases.

Time Complexity:
- Bubble Sort: O(n^2)  Gets very slow as the number of orders increases.
- Quick Sort: O(n log n) average case  Much faster, especially for large data.

Conclusion:
Bubble Sort is okay for small lists and learning purposes. 
But for real-world platforms (like e-commerce), Quick Sort is more efficient and recommended because of its better performance.
